Dr. Charalampos Lazaris is a member of the Oncology Data Science team at Novartis Biomedical Research in Cambridge, MA. He explores mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in order to uncover cancer vulnerabilities and target them therapeutically. He earned his Ph.D. at the NYU School of Medicine, under the supervision of Drs. Iannis Aifantis and Aristotelis Tsirigos. During his Ph.D., he focused on genetic alterations of topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries and their link with aberrant oncogene activation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a type of blood cancer common in children. He completed postdoctoral work at the USC Keck School of Medicine and the Whitehead Institute (MIT). He was also an Associated Scientist at the Klarman Cell Observatory of the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org). While at Broad Institute, he served as a vice-chair of the NextGen Association. He currently serves as the President of the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science Doctoral Alumni Association ([DAA](https://gsas.nyu.edu/student-life/doctoral-alumni-association.html)).
